# Pi Provider Factory

**Pi Provider Factory is an Oh My Pi provider extension for using Factory.ai Droid models from `omp`, including Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, GPT, Codex, GLM, Kimi, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Nemotron models through Factory's authenticated LLM gateway.**

Last updated: 2026-07-30

## What this package does

This package registers a custom `factory` provider for [Oh My Pi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent). It mirrors Factory Droid's authentication and request routing so `omp` can call Factory-hosted models with either Factory browser OAuth or a Factory API key.

Use it when you want:

- Factory.ai model access inside `omp`
- Droid-style Factory OAuth device login at `https://auth.factory.ai/device`
- Factory-routed Claude, GPT, Codex, and open-weight coding models
- Region-aware Factory API routing, including EU residency endpoints
- One provider namespace for Factory models such as `factory/claude-opus-4-8` and `factory/gpt-5.5`

## Supported models

The extension ships a 43-model curated static catalog, force-refreshes Factory's public model docs when an `omp` session starts, and merges any additional supported model IDs the docs list.

### Claude and Anthropic-family models

These models route through Factory's Anthropic-compatible gateway:

- `claude-fable-5`
- `claude-opus-5`
- `claude-opus-5-fast`
- `claude-opus-4-8`
- `claude-opus-4-8-fast`
- `claude-opus-4-7`

- `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`

### GPT and Codex models

These models route through Factory's OpenAI Responses-compatible gateway:

- `gpt-5.6-sol`
- `gpt-5.6-sol-fast`
- `gpt-5.6-terra`
- `gpt-5.6-luna`
- `gpt-5.5`

- `gpt-5.3-codex-fast`
- `gpt-5.2`

### Factory Core and open-weight chat models

These models route through Factory's OpenAI chat-completions-compatible gateway:

- `inkling`
- `glm-5.3`
- `glm-5.2`
- `glm-5.2-fast`
- `glm-5.1`
- `kimi-k3`
- `kimi-k2.7-code`
- `kimi-k2.6`
- `kimi-k2.5`
- `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`
- `deepseek-v4-pro`
- `minimax-m3`
- `minimax-m2.7`
- `minimax-m2.5`
- `nemotron-3-ultra`

## Request routing

Factory model requests go to Factory's LLM gateway. The default base URL is:

```text
https://api.factory.ai
```

OAuth credentials may provide a region-specific `apiEndpoint`, such as:

```text
https://api.eu.factory.ai
```

`FACTORY_API_BASE` overrides both the default host and any OAuth-provided `apiEndpoint`; this is useful for testing, proxies, or controlled environments.

| Model family | Base path | Wire API | Header |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude / Anthropic | `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/a` | Anthropic Messages `/v1/messages` | `x-api-provider: anthropic` |
| GPT / Codex | `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/o/v1` | OpenAI Responses `/responses` | `x-api-provider: openai` |
| GLM / Kimi / DeepSeek / MiniMax / Nemotron | `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/o/v1` | OpenAI Chat Completions `/chat/completions` | `x-api-provider: factory` |

Examples:

```text
factory/claude-opus-4-8
→ https://api.factory.ai/api/llm/a/v1/messages

factory/gpt-5.5
→ https://api.factory.ai/api/llm/o/v1/responses

factory/glm-5.1
→ https://api.factory.ai/api/llm/o/v1/chat/completions
```

The extension also sends Droid-compatible Factory headers, including `X-Factory-Client`, `X-Client-Version`, `X-Factory-Org-Id`, `x-session-id`, `x-assistant-message-id`, and the appropriate `x-api-provider` value.

## Installation

Install dependencies with Bun:

```zsh
bun install
```

Link the extension into `omp`:

```zsh
omp plugin link "$PWD"
```

Confirm the provider is discoverable:

```zsh
omp models find factory
```

Force a fresh Factory catalog fetch at any time:

```zsh
omp models refresh factory
```

This pulls Factory's public model docs for newly supported model IDs. If the docs fetch fails, the last successfully cached catalog is retained and the fetch is retried automatically — roughly every 5 minutes and at each session start.

## Authentication

### Browser OAuth, recommended

Run `omp`, log in to the Factory provider, and leave the API-key prompt blank:

```text
/login factory
```

The extension opens Factory's Droid device login URL:

```text
https://auth.factory.ai/device
```

After successful login, the extension stores refreshable OAuth credentials through Oh My Pi's normal provider auth storage.

### Factory API key

You can use a Factory API key by setting `FACTORY_API_KEY`:

```zsh
export FACTORY_API_KEY="fk-..."
```

When `FACTORY_API_KEY` is present, Oh My Pi treats it as the provider API key source. If you want to test OAuth instead, unset it first:

```zsh
unset FACTORY_API_KEY
```

Billing-limit reporting (`/usage`) is OAuth-only; API-key sessions never query it (see below).

## Usage reporting

Native `/usage` reports Factory account quotas for OAuth accounts. The extension queries `GET {apiEndpoint}/api/billing/limits` with the OAuth bearer and Droid-compatible headers, and renders:

- Standard 5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows
- Droid Core 5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows — inactive pools are shown explicitly as having no active window instead of looking like available quota
- Extra Usage balance as a remaining dollar amount, with eligibility and overage-preference notes

Queries use the same base-URL precedence as model routing (`FACTORY_API_BASE`, then the OAuth credential's region-specific `apiEndpoint`, then `https://api.factory.ai`) and reuse Oh My Pi's normal usage cache window and history recording.

The billing-limits endpoint is queried with OAuth credentials only. Factory `fk-...` API keys are intentionally never sent to it (a live probe returns `401`), so with only `FACTORY_API_KEY` configured, model calls still work but `/usage` shows no Factory billing limits by design.

Usage-provider registration for extensions requires an Oh My Pi release that includes it; on older releases Factory simply does not appear in `/usage` while model routing is unaffected.

### Organization and region handling

Factory's gateway requires an organization-scoped bearer token or an organization header. This extension derives the Factory organization ID from OAuth JWT claims or `/api/cli/whoami`, and it can recover WorkOS organization scope during refresh.

OAuth login and refresh support:

- WorkOS device authorization
- Organization-scoped token refresh
- Factory org ID extraction for `X-Factory-Org-Id`
- Region discovery via `/api/cli/whoami`
- Region-to-base-URL mapping, including `eu` → `https://api.eu.factory.ai`

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FACTORY_API_KEY` | Optional Factory `fk-...` API key. Takes precedence over OAuth in normal provider resolution. |
| `FACTORY_API_BASE` | Overrides the Factory API base URL for every request, including OAuth-discovered endpoints. |
| `FACTORY_ORG_ID` | Optional explicit Factory organization ID header value. |
| `FACTORY_ORGANIZATION_ID` | Alias for `FACTORY_ORG_ID`. |
| `FACTORY_UPSTREAM_CLIENT_TYPE` | Optional override for `X-Factory-Client`; defaults to `cli`. |

## Usage examples

> **Note:** `omp -p --model factory/<id>` does not currently work from a cold start: omp resolves `--model` before extension-provider catalogs hydrate, so factory models are only selectable in interactive mode. Tracked upstream in [oh-my-pi#4216](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4216).

Run a Factory model interactively:

```zsh
omp
```

Then select a model with the picker and prompt normally:

```text
/model
# filter for e.g. factory/claude-sonnet-5, Enter to select
reply with the single word ok
```

Any factory model works the same way, e.g. `factory/claude-opus-4-8`, `factory/gpt-5.5`, or `factory/glm-5.2`.

## Implementation notes

### Anthropic system prompt compatibility

Factory's Anthropic gateway rejects requests that use Anthropic's top-level `system` field. For Anthropic-family models only, this extension folds the system prompt into the first user turn before forwarding the request. OpenAI Responses and chat-completions routes keep their native prompt handling.

### API-key and OAuth credential formats

The router accepts either:

1. A raw bearer/API key string.
2. An OAuth credential envelope containing `access`, `orgId`, and `apiEndpoint`.

Raw OAuth JWTs are decoded locally only to derive non-secret routing metadata such as Factory org ID. Tokens are not logged or printed by the extension.

## Troubleshooting

### `No API key found for factory`

Run:

```text
/login factory
```

Then leave the `fk-...` prompt blank for browser OAuth, or paste a Factory API key.

### Factory login opens the wrong page

The expected OAuth URL is Factory's Droid device URL:

```text
https://auth.factory.ai/device
```

If you see a generic WorkOS authorize URL, relink this plugin and log in again:

```zsh
omp plugin link "$PWD"
omp
/logout factory
/login factory
```

### `403 Forbidden` from Factory

Most 403s are caused by one of these issues:

1. `FACTORY_API_KEY` is set and overriding OAuth credentials.
2. The OAuth token is not organization-scoped.
3. The request is missing `X-Factory-Org-Id`.
4. A non-droid system prompt was sent in the system field (Anthropic top-level `system`, OpenAI `instructions`, or a `system`-role message). Factory refuses non-droid system content on **every** route; the extension avoids this by folding the system prompt into the first user message.
5. The wrong regional endpoint is being used.

If `/api/cli/whoami` works but LLM calls still return `403 {"detail":"Forbidden",...}`, the credential is valid but Factory's LLM gateway is refusing that model/org request. Check Factory model entitlement for the org shown by the plugin diagnostic, then unset local overrides and re-login.

Start with a clean OAuth run:

```zsh
unset FACTORY_API_KEY FACTORY_ORG_ID FACTORY_ORGANIZATION_ID FACTORY_API_BASE
omp
/logout factory
/login factory
/model factory/claude-opus-4-8
```

Then test:

```text
reply with the single word ok
```

## FAQ

### What is Pi Provider Factory?

Pi Provider Factory is an Oh My Pi extension that adds a `factory` provider for Factory.ai's Droid LLM gateway. It lets `omp` use Factory-routed Claude, GPT, Codex, and open-weight coding models with Droid-compatible OAuth and request headers.

### Does this call Anthropic or OpenAI directly?

No. Requests go to Factory's gateway first. Factory then routes each request to the appropriate upstream family based on model ID and the `x-api-provider` header.

### Which endpoint does `factory/claude-opus-4-8` use?

`factory/claude-opus-4-8` uses Factory's Anthropic-compatible endpoint: `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/a/v1/messages`. By default, that is `https://api.factory.ai/api/llm/a/v1/messages`.

### Which endpoint does `factory/gpt-5.5` use?

`factory/gpt-5.5` uses Factory's OpenAI Responses-compatible endpoint: `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/o/v1/responses`.

### Which endpoint do Factory Core models use?

Most Factory Core open-weight models — `glm-5.2`, `glm-5.1`, `kimi-k2.7-code`, `kimi-k2.6`, `kimi-k2.5`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `nemotron-3-ultra` — use `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/o/v1/chat/completions`. MiniMax models (`minimax-m3`, `minimax-m2.7`, `minimax-m2.5`) are the exception: Factory serves them through the Anthropic-compatible endpoint `${apiEndpoint}/api/llm/a/v1/messages`. Every Factory Core model sends `x-api-provider: fireworks`.

### What `x-api-provider` value does each request send?

Factory's gateway routes by the `x-api-provider` request header, which names the upstream and is independent of the API shape. Values are taken from observed `droid` CLI traffic:

- `anthropic` — Claude models (Anthropic endpoint)
- `openai` — GPT and Codex models (OpenAI Responses endpoint)
- `fireworks` — all Droid Core open models (GLM, Kimi, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Nemotron), including MiniMax which is served over the Anthropic API shape

Sending the wrong value (for example `factory` for an open model) makes the gateway reject the request with `400 {"detail":"Invalid x-api-provider header"}`.

### How does the extension handle system prompts?

Factory's gateway enforces a client-attestation gate: it only accepts a request whose system field carries droid's own system prompt as a prefix. Any other system content — an Anthropic top-level `system`, an OpenAI `instructions` string, or a `system`-role chat message — is refused with `403 {"detail":"Forbidden",...}` on every route. A request with no system field is always accepted.

Because Oh My Pi sends its own system prompt (not droid's), the extension folds that prompt into the first user message — wrapped in `<system>…</system>` — and leaves the system field empty. This delivers the instructions to the model while satisfying the gate, and avoids bundling droid's proprietary prompt or injecting a conflicting "You are Droid" identity. The fold is applied on all three routes.

## Development

Run the TypeScript compiler:

```zsh
bunx tsc --noEmit
```

Run a live smoke test after authenticating — use interactive mode ([oh-my-pi#4216](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4216) blocks `-p --model factory/...`):

```zsh
unset FACTORY_API_KEY FACTORY_ORG_ID FACTORY_ORGANIZATION_ID FACTORY_API_BASE
omp
# /model → select factory/claude-opus-4-8 → prompt: reply with the single word ok
```

Expected output:

```text
ok
```
